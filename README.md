Pinball Game 

Simple pinball simulation with 2 paddles and a launcher
2 red bumpers that slow down the ball upon contact
2 green bumpers that reflect the ball and speed it up upon contact
1 Hit toy that gives more points upon contact, does not affect the speed
1 slider that shows the level of power the launcher will shoot at
